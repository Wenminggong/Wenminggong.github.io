# 👨‍🎓 About Me
Hello, I am Mingjiang Liu. I obtained my B.E. degree in automation and M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Department of Control and System Engineering at Nanjing University, in 2019 and 2022, respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chunlin Chen](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/ccl/list.htm).
