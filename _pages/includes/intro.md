# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
Hello, I am Mingjiang Liu. I obtained my B.E. degree in automation and M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Department of Control and System Engineering at Nanjing University, in 2019 and 2022, respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chunlin Chen](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/ccl/list.htm). Currently, I am  pursuing a Ph.D supervised by [Dr. Hailong Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-huang-hailong/) at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, PolyU and I am a member of the [Autonomous Interactive Mobile Systems (AIMS)](https://sites.google.com/view/hailong-huang/home) group at PolyU. 

My primary research interests lie in Robotics and Reinforcement Learning, particularly exploring the integration of conventional techniques with learning-based methods to enhance the robustness and adaptability of robot systems. Currently, I focus on the following research topics:

* Human-Robot Collaborative Transportation
* Learning for Dynamics, Control, and Planning
